#Hello again! Still not finished, not very close either. I'm starting to get the
#concepts though. My moment of triumph today was going back and actually under-
#standing the code that we did in class on Monday (The game of Pig). In addition,
#I'm digging the math related content, even though I haven't gotten to that
#portion of the assignment. More to come this morning; I believe I'll get a good
#bit more done on this before class. See you there!
