#Hello again! Still not finished, not very close either. I'm starting to get the
#concepts though. My moment of triumph today was going back and actually under-
#standing the code that we did in class on Monday (The game of Pig). In addition,
#I'm digging the math related content, even though I haven't gotten to that
#portion of the assignment. More to come this morning; I believe I'll get a good
#bit more done on this before class. See you there!

#Part of my problem is I'm not working with people and asking my peers questions
#as much I should be. I have a "I'll just figure it out myself/at home" mentality
#Which I'm quickly learning is not the best strategy.
